Prompt for the stopping tolerance.
Prompt for and read the initial guess of x.
  - Denote initial guess by pnew for now.
  - p = "old x", pnew = "new x"
Begin loop. Allow N iterations before giving up.
  - Set p = pnew.
  - Evaluate f(p) and f'(p).
  - Compute pnew = p - f(p)/f'(p) (Newton-Raphson formula).
  - If |pnew - p| is less than the tolerance, write answer and quit.
  - Otherwise, continue looping.
End loop.
Write an error message: method did not converge in N steps.
